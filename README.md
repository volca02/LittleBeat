# LittleBeat

This is a standalone drum sound synthesizer project, based on the code from Mutable Peaks drum section.

The project is licensed under MIT license, in accordance to the Peaks original source code license.

The project runs on ESP32, with MIDI in on Serial2 RX (GPIO16), I2S connection to PCM5102 on BCK:GPIO26, LCRK:GPIO25, DATA:GPIO22.

The plan is to finalize the project with an OLED display, rotary encoder for parameter setting and a few buttons for simplified controls. Then 3D print a box for the project to reside in.
